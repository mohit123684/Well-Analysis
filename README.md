# Well-Analysis
This project analyzes LAS file data to find optimal oil and gas extraction zones. By examining well-log data (Gamma Ray, Neutron Porosity, Sonic, Deep Resistivity, and Bulk Density), it identifies high-potential areas between 1600-1800 meters depth, providing key insights for better exploration and extraction.
